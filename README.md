# Additional Material for NIME 2025 Submission

----

# Max Device

# Ableton Project (Ready for Testing)

For anonymizing the submission, the generative plugin has been removed from the project. That said, a recording of the output of the system is shared in the project. 

# Recordings

- **AudioSnippets.mp3**: Three short snippets from the rehearsals and the eventual show
- **Vid1.mp4**: A short recording from audience level at the eventual show

- The audio from the performance was recorded, but we have not been given access to them yet. We will be sharing the recordings soon (if release permissions are granted)
